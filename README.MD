/blink01:

    This directory contains a bare metal code that blinks a led on gpio4.
    To run the code on your raspberry pi zero 2W, you need to format the SD as FAT32 and add the following files:
    
    bootcode.bin
    kernel8.img
    start.elf

    The "bootcode.bin" and "start.elf" were obtained from raspberry pi official repository:
    https://github.com/raspberrypi/firmware/tree/master/boot

    To compile it, just run "make" on blinker01 directory.
